  <h1>Legal FAQs — Learn With Mr. Oddlaw</h1>
  <p>Because justice isn’t magic — it’s method. Here are straight answers to the questions people ask most about standing your ground in court.</p>
</header>

<div class="wrap">

  <h2>1. What does “How to Win in Court Without a Lawyer” actually teach?</h2>
  <p>It’s a complete course created by attorney <strong>Dr. Frederick Graves</strong> that shows how real courtroom victories happen — by learning to <strong>allege the facts, prove the facts, and move the judge.</strong> These are the same fundamentals lawyers master in law school, simplified so anyone can understand and use them.</p>

  <h2>2. Why does Mr. Oddlaw say “learn the rules before you need them”?</h2>
  <p>Because most people lose cases from <em>not knowing procedure</em> — not because they were wrong. When you understand how the rules of court work, you stop being intimidated by the system and start using it properly. Knowledge is your legal armor.</p>

  <h2>3. What are the benefits of learning pro se court skills?</h2>
  <p>Learning to represent yourself — called going <em>pro se</em> — helps you protect your rights without draining your wallet. It builds confidence, earns respect from the bench, and teaches you to use the same written rules and evidence strategies attorneys rely on every day.</p>

  <h2>4. Is this information recognized by real attorneys?</h2>
  <p>Yes. Since 1997, lawyers, paralegals, and even retired judges have praised the <em>How to Win in Court</em> program for making courtroom procedure clear and practical. It’s legal education translated into plain English.</p>

  <h2>5. How can someone win a case without hiring a lawyer?</h2>
  <p>You win by using <strong>written procedure</strong> — motions, affidavits, and rules of evidence — to guide the judge toward a lawful decision. It’s not about emotion or theatrics; it’s about precision, paperwork, and persistence.</p>

  <h2>6. What are the “3 Easy Steps to Justice”?</h2>
  <p><strong>Step 1 — Allege the Facts:</strong> State clearly what happened and which rule or law applies.<br>
     <strong>Step 2 — Prove the Facts:</strong> Support every claim with admissible evidence — documents, testimony, or exhibits.<br>
     <strong>Step 3 — Move the Judge:</strong> File written motions that compel legal action in your favor.  
     <br><br>This process isn’t theory — it’s how every real case is won.</p>

  <h2>7. Why do people lose in court even when they’re right?</h2>
  <p>Truth alone isn’t enough. Courtrooms run on <strong>rules of procedure and evidence.</strong> If you don’t know how to object, file motions, or keep the record clean, the system doesn’t “see” your truth. The law rewards preparation, not emotion.</p>

  <h2>8. What is a motion and why is it important?</h2>
  <p>A motion is a <strong>written request</strong> asking the judge to take a specific action — to dismiss a case, compel evidence, or enforce a rule. Learning to draft and argue motions gives you real control over your case and the official record.</p>

  <h2>9. Can self-represented people stand up to biased judges or dishonest lawyers?</h2>
  <p>Yes. When you understand procedure, you can hold everyone — even the judge — accountable to the same written rules. The courtroom respects those who know the law. Knowledge turns fear into leverage.</p>
