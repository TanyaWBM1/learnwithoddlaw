  <h1>Legal FAQs</h1>
  <p>Common questions answered by <strong>Learn With Mr. Oddlaw</strong> — because knowing the rules is how you win.</p>
</header>

<div class="wrap">

  <h2>1. What does “pro se” mean?</h2>
  <p>“Pro se” is Latin for “on one’s own behalf.” It means you are representing yourself in court without hiring a lawyer.  Thousands of Americans do it every year — but success depends on understanding <strong>procedure, evidence, and court rules</strong>.  That’s where Mr. Oddlaw’s lessons begin.</p>

  <h2>2. Can I really win in court without a lawyer?</h2>
  <p>Yes — if you learn the rules.  The courtroom runs on procedure, not emotion.  By mastering how to <strong>allege the facts, prove the facts, and move the judge</strong>, you can present your case with the same tactical precision lawyers use.</p>

  <h2>3. What is the “3-Step Formula” I keep hearing about?</h2>
  <p>It’s the backbone of courtroom strategy:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left:30px;line-height:1.7;">
    <li><strong>Step 1 – Allege the Facts:</strong> Tell the court exactly what happened and what rule was broken.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2 – Prove the Facts:</strong> Support every statement with admissible evidence — documents, testimony, or exhibits.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3 – Move the Judge:</strong> File written motions and requests that compel legal action in your favor.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This formula, taught in the <em>How to Win in Court Course</em>, has helped everyday people stand toe-to-toe with attorneys.</p>

  <h2>4. Is this legal advice?</h2>
  <p>No. The information here is for <strong>educational purposes only</strong>.  Mr. Oddlaw is a fictional educator who explains how the system works so you can make informed choices.  Always consult a licensed attorney for case-specific advice.</p>

  <h2>5. Who created Learn With Mr. Oddlaw?</h2>
  <p><strong>Tanya Lawson</strong> created the Mr. Oddlaw educational project to make courtroom knowledge accessible and understandable.  The site partners as an affiliate with the <em>Jurisdictionary® How to Win in Court</em> program by Dr. Frederick Graves — a lawyer with more than 40 years of real-world courtroom experience.</p>

  <h2>6. How does the affiliate link work?</h2>
