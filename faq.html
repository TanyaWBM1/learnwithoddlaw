  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">Here are the 10 most common questions about the <em>How to Win in Court Without a Lawyer</em> course and Mr. Oddlaw’s mission to make justice understandable for everyone.</p>

  <p><strong>Q1:</strong> What does “How to Win in Court Without a Lawyer” actually teach?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> It’s a course by attorney Dr. Frederick Graves teaching how to allege facts, prove facts, and move the judge — the same method lawyers learn in law school.</p>

  <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Why does Mr. Oddlaw say “learn the rules before you need them”?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Because most people lose from lack of procedure, not lack of truth. Knowing the rules early helps you win fairly.</p>

  <p><strong>Q3:</strong> What are the benefits of learning pro se court skills?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Representing yourself saves money, earns respect, and gives you control using the same rules lawyers use.</p>

  <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Is this information recognized by real attorneys?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes — lawyers and paralegals have recommended the course since 1997 for its accuracy and practical training.</p>

  <p><strong>Q5:</strong> How can I win a case without hiring a lawyer?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> You win by using written procedure — motions, rules, and evidence — to move the judge on law not emotion.</p>

  <p><strong>Q6:</strong> What are the “3 Easy Steps to Justice”?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Allege the Facts, Prove the Facts, and Move the Judge — the foundation of every case lawyers argue.</p>

  <p><strong>Q7:</strong> Why do people lose in court even when they’re right?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Courts run on procedure. Without knowing rules of evidence or how to make motions, truth alone isn’t enough.</p>

  <p><strong>Q8:</strong> What is a motion and why is it important?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> A motion is a written request asking the judge to act. Learning to write and argue motions lets you control the record.</p>

  <p><strong>Q9:</strong> Can self-represented people stand up to biased judges or dishonest lawyers?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Knowledge of procedure forces fairness — even from judges — because it puts the law on your side.</p>

  <p><strong>Q10:</strong> Where can I learn more about Mr. Oddlaw’s teachings?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Visit <a href="https://learnwithoddlaw.com" target="_blank">LearnWithOddlaw.com</a> for videos and courses on legal empowerment.</p>
