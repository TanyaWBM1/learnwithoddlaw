         Group A — Getting Started
    ======================== -->
    <section class="section" id="getting-started">
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p class="sub">Pro se basics, what it means, and whether you should do it.</p>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>Do I have to hire a lawyer, or can I represent myself?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>You have the right to represent yourself in most civil cases. If you go pro se, the court will hold you to the same rules lawyers follow: formatting, deadlines, service, evidence—everything. For complex or high-stakes matters (custody, immigration, serious criminal exposure, parental kidnapping), consider at least consulting an attorney or seeking limited-scope help.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: If the outcome affects housing, kids, immigration status, or liberty, get a legal consult—even if you still file and argue on your own.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>What does “pro se” mean, and what does it involve?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p><em>Pro se</em> means “for oneself.” You handle everything: research, drafting, filing, serving, evidence, hearings, objections, and possibly appeals. It’s work—but with discipline and the rules, it’s doable.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Treat your case like a project. Make a checklist for filings, deadlines, service, evidence, and hearing prep—and follow it.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>What are the risks and advantages of self-representation?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Save attorney fees, keep full control, learn skills for life, and move at your own pace.</p>
          <p><strong>Risks:</strong> You’re responsible for every rule. Mistakes—missed deadlines, bad service, improper evidence—can sink a winning case. The court won’t coach you.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Offset risk with education. Read your jurisdiction’s <strong>Rules of Procedure</strong> and <strong>Rules of Evidence</strong> first.</p>
        </div>

      <h2>Court Expectations & Treatment</h2>
      <p class="sub">What judges expect and how courts treat self-represented litigants.</p>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>What will the judge expect from me as a self-represented litigant?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Judges expect basic competency: know why you’re in court, follow deadlines, file proper papers, serve correctly, present admissible evidence, and behave professionally. You don’t need legal buzzwords—you need clean procedure.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Write your <strong>ask</strong> in one sentence (the relief). Everything else supports that ask.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>How will the court treat me if I am not a lawyer?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Courts must treat you fairly—but they won’t relax the rules. Some judges are patient; some are strict. Either way, precision earns respect.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Professional tone + proper forms + punctuality = credibility. Credibility moves judges.</p>

      <h2>Procedures & Rules</h2>
      <p class="sub">The playbook: filing, evidence, objections, discovery, and motions.</p>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>What court procedures and legal rules do I need to know?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Start with: (1) your court’s <strong>Rules of Civil Procedure</strong>, (2) <strong>Rules of Evidence</strong>, (3) any local rules/standing orders, and (4) scheduling orders in your case. Learn filing formats, service methods, motion practice, discovery basics, and hearing procedures.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Print or bookmark the table of contents of your Rules. You’ll reference it constantly.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>What is a motion, and why is it important?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>A motion is a <strong>written request</strong> asking the judge to take a specific action (dismiss, compel, extend time, exclude evidence). Motions steer the case and build a clean record for appeal.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Start every motion with a one-sentence “Relief Requested.” Then the facts. Then the law. Then the ask again.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>How do I write and file a complaint, motion, or other documents?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Use proper captioning, numbered paragraphs, headings in plain English, and cite the rules you rely on. Save to PDF, file with the clerk per local rules (e-filing or in person), and <strong>serve the other side</strong> using an approved method. Keep stamped copies and proofs of service.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Study a few filings from your court’s public docket and mirror the format—not the drama.</p>

        <summary><span class="caret"></span>What forms and documents must I file to begin my case?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Typically: a <strong>Complaint/Petition</strong> (parties, facts, legal claims, relief requested), a <strong>Civil Cover Sheet</strong> (if required), and <strong>Summons</strong> for each defendant. Some courts require case information statements or fee waivers.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Your complaint should answer three things: Who did what, what rule/law was violated, and what you want the court to do.</p>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>Can someone at the court help me or answer my questions?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Court staff can explain procedures and point you to forms but cannot give legal advice or tell you what to argue. Many courts have self-help centers and clinics.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Ask for <strong>procedural</strong> help: “Which form do I use?” is OK. “Should I sue?” is legal advice—they can’t answer.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>Where can I get help or resources for filling out and filing paperwork?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Use your court’s self-help center, law library, and official forms. Legal aid and limited-scope attorneys can review documents. <a href="represent-yourself.html">Our Pro Se page</a> links the free PDF handbook and trusted training.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Keep a binder (or cloud folder) with tabs: <em>Pleadings</em>, <em>Evidence</em>, <em>Service Proofs</em>, <em>Orders</em>, <em>Deadlines</em>.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>Can I consult an attorney or get limited help if I represent myself?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes. Many jurisdictions allow <strong>limited-scope representation</strong> (unbundled services). You stay pro se while an attorney reviews filings, drafts a motion, or coaches you for a hearing.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Ask attorneys for a 60-minute “document review” or “strategy session” rate.</p>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>What deadlines do I need to meet, and how do I keep track?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Deadlines govern answers, motions, discovery, disclosures, and appeals. Missing one can end your case. Use a calendar (digital + paper), set reminders, and confirm time-counting rules (business days vs. calendar days; adding days for mail).</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: At the moment you get served or receive an order, write the due date on the document and in your calendar. Double-check the rule for counting days.</p>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Lawyers know procedure cold and exploit gaps. Expect fast deadlines, dense filings, and evidence challenges. They cannot advise you. Your defense is paperwork precision: timely responses, rule-based objections, and clean records.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Never ignore their filings. Calendar the response deadline the same day you receive it and draft immediately.</p>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Collect documents, photos, records, messages, and witness statements. Authenticate them (who wrote it, when, how kept). Mark exhibits (Ex. A, Ex. B) and make an index. Follow the <strong>Rules of Evidence</strong> for relevance, hearsay exceptions, and foundation.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Create a one-page “Exhibit List” with columns: ID, Description, Relevance, Foundation Witness.</p>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="caret"></span>How can I prepare to question witnesses (including myself)?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Write short, clear questions in sequence. For friendly witnesses, use open-ended questions. For hostile witnesses, use leading questions. Practice transitions and likely objections. If you testify, practice your direct like a story supported by exhibits.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Tie each witness to a specific element you must prove. If it doesn’t prove an element, you don’t need the question.</p>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Bring: copies of your filings, indexed exhibits, a notepad, pens, a simple outline of your argument, and a calendar. Keep everything in a labeled binder or accordion file so you can find it in seconds.</p>

          <p>Review the rules, confirm the time and courtroom, prep objections, practice your opening/closing, and rehearse exhibit foundations. Arrive early, dress simply, and silence your phone. You’re there to advocate, not entertain.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: Time yourself. If the court gives you 10 minutes, practice a 7-minute version and a 10-minute version.</p>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>You may have the right to appeal, but timelines are short and rules are strict. Appeals focus on legal error in the record, not re-trying facts. Consider consulting an appellate attorney even if you stay pro se.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: The single most important appeals habit is this: <strong>protect the record now</strong> with timely objections and written motions.</p>

        <summary><span class="caret"></span>Why does Mr. Oddlaw say “learn the rules before you need them”?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Because most losses are procedural, not moral. Knowing deadlines, service, motions, and evidence lets you turn fear into leverage—and chaos into a clean record.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: One weekend of disciplined rule-reading can save six months of mistakes.</p>

        <summary><span class="caret"></span>How can someone win without hiring a lawyer?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>By mastering written procedure: motions, affidavits, evidence foundations, and timely objections. Judges rule on paper and law—not on who “sounds” right.</p>
          <p class="protip">Pro Tip: If it’s not in the record, it didn’t happen. File it. Serve it. Save the proof.</p>

For complex or high-stakes matters (custody, immigration, serious criminal exposure, parental kidnapping), consider consulting an attorney or seeking limited-scope help."
